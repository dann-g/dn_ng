The code for my personal site.

### Changelog 
[Aug-13-2023](#2023-08-13)

I've cloned this from my old college github, mainly because the code from that profile is from a time that I was unconcerned about what my code and work lookslike.
I think this project out of all my projects was the one that felt the most genuine to me.
Now I care more about what I write.
